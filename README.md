# Program4VisualBasic
This is my fourth programming assignment for my Visual Basic Advanced class.

Instructions:
Rough Riders Rodeo wants to sell tickets online. Allow the user to enter the number of tickets needed. The data entry screen should also include the shipping address for the tickets, a credit card number, expiration date, and a drop-down box allowing the user to enter the type of credit card. Also include a check box for attending the Awards Event. Include a hyperlink for confirming the order. Make the link invisible to begin with, but display it after the Submit button has been clicked.

The confirmation page should say "Thank you for your order".

The tickets are $15 for just the rodeo, $25 if they want to attend the awards event. Note that all members of the party must select the same type tickets.

When a user selects the Submit button, display the amount due and display a link to confirom the order (make the existing link visible). Use an UpdatePanel to improve performance.
